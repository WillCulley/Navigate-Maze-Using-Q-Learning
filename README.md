# Navigate-Maze-Using-Q-Learning
This code uses Q-Learning, a form of reinforcement learning, to train an agent to navigate a 100 by 100 maze filled with walls. The agent must navigate from the start position (top left corner) of the maze to the end position (bottom right corner) of the maze. The agent determines the optimal route, then outputs this in the terminal.
